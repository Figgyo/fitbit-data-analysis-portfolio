- **Device Engagement:** Analysis of how consistently users interact with their fitness trackers.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigation of the relationships between physical activity, sleep, and calories burned.
- **Marketing Opportunities:** Recommendations for leveraging user behavior insights to inform product messaging and user engagement strategies.
